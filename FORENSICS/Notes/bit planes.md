### What are Bit Planes?

- An image is usually represented by a matrix of pixel values, with each pixel having a certain number of bits (e.g., an 8-bit grayscale image has 256 possible values per pixel, and each pixel is represented by 8 bits).
- A bit plane refers to one layer of the bits across all pixels. For example, the most significant bit (MSB) plane captures the highest-order bits across all pixels, while the least significant bit (LSB) plane captures the lowest-order bits.
