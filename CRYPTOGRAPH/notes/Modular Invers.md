In the equation $(a \cdot n) \mod m = b$, where:
- \( a \) is the unknown multiplier,
- \( n \) is a known random integer,
- \( m \) is a known modulus,
- \( b \) is the known result,

the modular inverse is needed to solve for \( a \). Let's break down the reasoning:
### Purpose of the Modular Inverse

1. **Rearranging the Equation**:
   The original equation can be rearranged to isolate \( a \):
   $a \cdot n \equiv b \mod m$

2. **Isolating \( a \)**:
   To solve for \( a \), you need to "divide" by \( n \). However, division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward. Instead, you multiply both sides by the modular inverse of \( n \) modulo \( m \):
$a \equiv b \cdot n^{-1} \mod m$
   

   Here, \( $n^{-1}$\) is the modular inverse of \( n \) modulo \( m \). This step is essential because it allows you to effectively perform a division operation in the modular world.
### Conditions for Existence
- **Coprimality**: The modular inverse \( $n^{-1}$ \) exists if and only if \( n \) and \( m \) are coprime (i.e., \($\gcd(n, m) = 1)$). If they are not coprime, \( n \) does not have a modular inverse, and you cannot isolate \( a \) in the equation.
### Example
Letâ€™s say:
- \( m = 257 \ (a prime number),
- \( n = 5 \ (random integer),
- \( b = 38 \.

1. Check if \( n \) and \( m \) are coprime:
   - \($gcd(5, 257) = 1$\ (yes, they are coprime).
  
2. Find the modular inverse of \( n \) modulo \( m \):
   - Calculate \($n^{-1} \mod 257$ (let's say it results in \( 155 \)).

3. Substitute back to solve for \( a \):
   $a \equiv 38 \cdot 155 \mod 257$
   Now, you can compute \( a \).

### Summary

- **Modular inverses are crucial for solving equations in modular arithmetic**, particularly when you need to isolate an unknown variable.
- When you have a product of an unknown and a known number modulo a given modulus, the modular inverse allows you to "divide" in the context of modular arithmetic, enabling the solution for the unknown.
