## Username enumeration

Username enumeration is when an attacker is able to observe changes in the website's behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid.

Username enumeration typically occurs either on the login page, for example, when you enter a valid username but an incorrect password, or on registration forms when you enter a username that is already taken. This greatly reduces the time and effort required to brute-force a login because the attacker is able to quickly generate a shortlist of valid usernames.

While attempting to [[brute-force]] a login page, you should pay particular attention to any differences in:

- **Status codes**: During a brute-force attack, the returned HTTP status code is likely to be the same for the vast majority of guesses because most of them will be wrong. If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct. It is best practice for websites to always return the same status code regardless of the outcome, but this practice is not always followed.
- **Error messages**: Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND password are incorrect or only the password was incorrect. It is best practice for websites to use identical, generic messages in both cases, but small typing errors sometimes creep in. Just one character out of place makes the two messages distinct, even in cases where the character is not visible on the rendered page.
- **Response times**: If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, any that deviate from this suggest that something different was happening behind the scenes. This is another indication that the guessed username might be correct. For example, a website might only check whether the password is correct if the username is valid. This extra step might cause a slight increase in the response time. This may be subtle, but an attacker can make this delay more obvious by entering an excessively long password that the website takes noticeably longer to handle.

## Lab
#### Lab: Username enumeration via different responses
[link](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/authentication-vulnerabilities/password-based-vulnerabilities/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-different-responses#)
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

- [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate p
- asswords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
##### Method
1. With Burp running, investigate the login page and submit an invalid username and password.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and find the `POST /login` request. Highlight the value of the `username` parameter in the request and send it to Burp Intruder.![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.02.36.png]]
3. In Burp Intruder, notice that the `username` parameter is automatically set as a payload position. This position is indicated by two `§` symbols, for example: `username=§invalid-username§`. Leave the password as any static value for now.![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.04.13.png]]
5. Make sure that **Sniper attack** is selected.
6. In the **Payloads** side panel, make sure that the **Simple list** payload type is selected.![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.06.55.png]]
7. Under **Payload configuration**, paste the list of candidate usernames. Finally, click **Start attack**. The attack will start in a new window.
8. When the attack is finished, examine the **Length** column in the results table. You can click on the column header to sort the results. Notice that one of the entries is longer than the others. Compare the response to this payload with the other responses. Notice that other responses contain the message `Invalid username`, but this response says `Incorrect password`. Make a note of the username in the **Payload** column.![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.08.19.png]]
9. Close the attack and go back to the **Intruder** tab. Click **Clear §**, then change the `username` parameter to the username you just identified. Add a payload position to the `password` parameter. The result should look something like this:
    `username=identified-user&password=§invalid-password§`![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.09.09.png]]
9. In the **Payloads** side panel, clear the list of usernames and replace it with the list of candidate passwords. Click **Start attack**.
10. When the attack is finished, look at the **Status** column. Notice that each request received a response with a `200` status code except for one, which got a `302` response. This suggests that the login attempt was successful - make a note of the password in the **Payload** column.![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.10.02.png]]
11. Log in using the username and password that you identified and access the user account page to solve the lab.![[Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 11.11.30.png]]

#### Lab: Username enumeration via response timing
[link](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/authentication-vulnerabilities/password-based-vulnerabilities/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-response-timing)
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

##### Method
1. With Burp running, submit an invalid username and password, then send the `POST /login` request to Burp Repeater. Experiment with different usernames and passwords. Notice that your IP will be blocked if you make too many invalid login attempts.
2. Identify that the `X-Forwarded-For` header is supported, which allows you to spoof your IP address and bypass the IP-based brute-force protection.
3. Continue experimenting with usernames and passwords. Pay particular attention to the response times. Notice that when the username is invalid, the response time is roughly the same. However, when you enter a valid username (your own), the response time is increased depending on the length of the password you entered.
4. Send this request to Burp Intruder and select **Pitchfork attack** from the attack type drop-down menu. Add the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
5. Add payload positions for the `X-Forwarded-For` header and the `username` parameter. Set the password to a very long string of characters (about 100 characters should do it).
6. In the **Payloads** side panel, select position `1` from the **Payload position** drop-down list. Select the **Numbers** payload type. Enter the range 1 - 100 and set the step to 1. Set the max fraction digits to 0. This will be used to spoof your IP.
7. Select position `2` from the **Payload position** drop-down list, then add the list of usernames. Start the attack.
8. When the attack finishes, at the top of the dialog, click **Columns** and select the **Response received** and **Response completed** options. These two columns are now displayed in the results table.
9. Notice that one of the response times was significantly longer than the others. Repeat this request a few times to make sure it consistently takes longer, then make a note of this username.
10. Create a new Burp Intruder attack for the same request. Add the `X-Forwarded-For` header again and add a payload position to it. Insert the username that you just identified and add a payload position to the `password` parameter.
11. In the **Payloads** side panel, add the list of numbers to payload position 1 and add the list of passwords to payload position 2. Start the attack.
12. When the attack is finished, find the response with a `302` status. Make a note of this password.
13. Log in using the username and password that you identified and access the user account page to solve the lab.
